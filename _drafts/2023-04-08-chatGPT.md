Hands on how to register chatGPT in domestic science

The process is relatively simple and consists of the following 3 steps:

- Scientific Internet access
- Register ChatGPT
- Cell phone number to receive the verification code





# Scientific Internet access

If you already have scientific Internet access, you can skip this step.

Scientific Internet access is not only for chatGPT, but also for ins, tubing, face, telegram, Twitter, etc. So it is very necessary to have a scientific Internet account. Here we recommend shadowsocks service, I personally have been using it for 4 years, it is relatively stable and reasonably priced, only about 100 yuan for a year, and even cheaper to renew.
